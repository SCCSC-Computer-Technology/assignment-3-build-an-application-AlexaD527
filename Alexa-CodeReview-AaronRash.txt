Alexa code review by Aaron Rash

I havent seen anyone else use html yet, so that was an interesting choice that stands out.

This is a solid project, so I'm going to have to nitpick a little bit.

A few extra comments wouldn't hurt. While I can read and understand your code, it would certainly speed up the process for an amatuer like me.

You can format the datagridview columns to be more readable. Such as setting the income as currency, or adding commas to the population (10,000 vs 10000)
	Edit columns > Appearance > DefaultCellStyle > Behavior > Format

Obviously not a requirment, more like a cherry on top

Otherwise the code is fully functional and meets all requirements, great job
