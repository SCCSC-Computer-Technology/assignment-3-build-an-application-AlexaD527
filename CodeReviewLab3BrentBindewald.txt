Lab 3 Code Review:

For this review I downloaded and ran assignment-3-build-an-application-AlexaD527. There were no initial issues when launching the program. The UI is organized cleanly, and effecinetly. All three sorting buttons worked as intended. No other issues when updating table/state information. Overall very well done.
